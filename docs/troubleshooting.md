# Troubleshooting

Use the launcher's recovery actions before manually changing AVD files. Keep
diagnostics narrow and sanitized.

## Installation does not complete

Check available disk space and Internet access, then retry. Partial component
downloads are resumable. **Repair Installation** rechecks the host, manifest,
component layout, hashes, runtime template, AVD, and game installation without
clearing an otherwise valid AVD.

The launcher log is under
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/Mactician/logs/launcher.log`.
Share only the small section around the error after removing home paths,
identifiers, and unrelated output.

## Component hash verification fails

Do not edit the expected hash. Remove only the named incomplete archive from
the launcher's `downloads/` directory and retry on a trusted network. A repeat
failure can mean an upstream archive changed; that requires a reviewed manifest
update, not a local bypass.

For build-time APK mismatches, confirm `TFT_GAME_APK_DIR` contains the exact
four pinned, unmodified splits listed in `release-manifest.json`.

## Emulator does not start

- Confirm the Mac is Apple Silicon, macOS is 12.0 or later, and Hypervisor
  Framework is available.
- Run `./scripts/verify-environment.sh` for the source-tree runtime.
- Set `TFT_ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, or `ANDROID_HOME` when the SDK
  is outside the standard macOS directory.
- Set `TFT_AVD_HOME` and `TFT_AVD_NAME` when using an external source-tree AVD.
- Use **Repair Installation** for missing launcher-managed components.
- Use **Reset** only when the launcher reports corrupted AVD state and preserving
  Riot/game state is less important than recreating the AVD.

## Another emulator process is running

Close other Android Emulator or PlayDroid/OSFT virtual machines before launch or
provisioning. The project isolates its ADB server on port 5038, but simultaneous
VMs still compete for host CPU/GPU and can mutate shared expectations. Do not
kill an unrelated process unless you have identified it.

## TFT restarts inside the AVD

The launcher keeps the verified APK and device-profile overlays mounted for the
whole AVD session so a Riot disconnect or TFT process restart retains the
selected graphics path. UI scale and game locale are applied during launcher
startup; if an independent restart does not retain the intended presentation,
close the emulator and press Play again.

## Hotkeys do not work

Grant Accessibility permission to **Mactician**, not the emulator, in
System Settings. The bridge retries after permission is granted. Hotkeys are
deliberately inactive outside TFT's exact `GameActivity`; the official Riot
login WebView and unknown activities pass input through unchanged.

## Repair versus Reset

**Repair Installation** preserves the AVD, Riot sign-in, game assets, and
preferences while re-verifying and refreshing launcher-owned pieces.

**Reset** removes the entire Application Support directory, including the AVD,
Riot sign-in, game data, downloads, state, and logs. It cannot be undone by the
launcher.

## Streaming-install cache is damaged

An interrupted public asset download can leave a zero-byte
`StreamingInstalls/Metadata.manifest`. The runtime detects exactly this case and
removes only `StreamingInstalls` so TFT can download public assets again. It
does not clear Riot sign-in or other app data. Use Repair to refresh this logic
on an existing installation.

## Pinned game version does not match

The launcher intentionally refuses to mount an OpenGL overlay over an unknown
`base.apk`. Install a launcher release built for the new TFT version. Do not
replace hashes or patch the installed APK to force compatibility.

## Update check fails

Confirm Internet access and system time, then retry **Check for Updates…**. Do
not disable Ed25519 verification or replace the appcast URL. If the feed is
temporarily unavailable, the installed launcher remains usable; updates are not
automatic without confirmation.

## Safe diagnostics

Prefer launcher status, `wm size`, `wm density`, filtered process lists,
`dumpsys input`, `dumpsys display`, `dumpsys gfxinfo`, and short, purpose-built
captures. Never post complete game logs, AVD images, `/data/anr` archives,
Keychain output, cookies, tokens, credentials, or unfiltered crash memory.
